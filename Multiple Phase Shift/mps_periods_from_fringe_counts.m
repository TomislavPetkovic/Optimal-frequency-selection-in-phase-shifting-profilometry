function [lambda, width] = mps_periods_from_fringe_counts(count, width)
% MPS_PERIODS_FROM_FRINGE_COUNTS Returns periods from fringe counts.
%   lambda = MPS_PERIODS_FROM_FRINGE_COUNTS(count) returns an array of
%   whole numbers lambda which holds periods for fringes with fringe counts
%   stored in array count. All numbers stored in count must be whole.
%
%   For MPS methods each fringe pattern has a number lambda which describes
%   in how many intervals one fringe period has to be divided. For MPS
%   structured light strategies sometimes it is simpler to define fringe
%   patterns by the number of fringes that fit into one projector screen,
%   which is fringe count, instead of using lambda, which is a virutal
%   number that defines number of segments in one period. This functions
%   converts the number of fringes into number of segments per period.
%
%   [lambda, width] = MPS_PERIODS_FROM_FRINGE_COUNTS(count) also returns
%   maximal (virtual) width of the projector screen. When computing the
%   projector coordinate unwrapped value may be divided by width and
%   multiplied by true projector width in px to obtain required coordinate
%   in projector coordinate system. Note that maximal allowable width is
%   the least common multiple of all fringe counts.
%
%   [lambda, width] = MPS_PERIODS_FROM_FRINGE_COUNTS(count, width) uses
%   supplied width to compute periods. If width is supplied then both count
%   and lambda may be real numbers.
