function d_min = mps_get_minimal_distance(Xk, Xv)
% MPS_GET_MINIMAL_DISTANCE Returns minimal half-distance between centers.
%   d_min = MPS_GET_MINIMAL_DISTANCE(Xk, Xv) returns minimal distance
%   between points stored in inputs Xk and Xk. The input Xk stores points
%   that correspond to centers of valid period tuples. The input Xv is a
%   cell array which stores points that corresponds to vertices on the
%   edges of the hypercube (less the vertices at 0 and 2pi) and their
%   correspondent wrapped period order vectors and indices of true period
%   order vector. The first column of Xv stores points, the second column
%   of Xv stores wrapped period order vectors, and the third stores index
%   of true period order vector.
%
%   Returned distance d_min may be used to speed up classification: if the
%   test point is closer to the period tuple center point than d we know it
%   certainly belongs to that period tuple as all remaining centers are
%   further away.
